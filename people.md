# Language, Speech and Learning (LSL)

*Language, Speech and Learning (LSL)* is a small research group at Stellenbosch University working on methods allowing speech and language processing systems to be developed with as little supervision as possible. The hope is that this endeavour will lead to new insights in machine and human learning. Apart from the students listed below, LSL also has a number of members from the DSP laboratory and [MediaLab](https://ml.sun.ac.za/) at Stellenbosch.

### Current students

- Leanne Nortje (PhD)
- Benjamin van Niekerk (PhD)
- Christiaan Jacobs (PhD)
- [Matthew Baas](https://rf5.github.io/) (PhD)
- Nicol Visser (MEng)
- Urs de Swardt (MEng)
