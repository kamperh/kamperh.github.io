### Overview

There are many good resources on the structure and philosophy behind academic
writing. I mention some of these in the first section below. But this note is
different: it is simply a (growing) list of things that I keep on telling
students when reviewing paper or thesis drafts. These are mainly about
nitty-gritty things (instead of the bigger story, which is arguably more
important). But it is still important to get these things right.

Two disclaimers. First, parts of this note convey my personal writing
preferences (and it might sound quite opinionated, because it is). I try to
state when something is a stylistic choice rather than a rule which you should
really follow. Second, I wrote parts of the note in anger, normally after
reviewing many paper and thesis drafts in a short space of time. So sorry if I
sometimes sound a bit blunt!
